It is a "Radar monitoring system project".In this project i created a circuit where ultrasonic sensor working for detecting an object,servo motor also used in this,it is used to help ultrasonic sensor for move  at certain angle like what actual radar system can do. We place ultrasonic Sensor on servo motor so that ultrasonic sensor move along with servo motor like actual radar system works. Whenever any certain object comes under the range which defined it's detect by ultrasonic sensor.For showing actual monitoring like Radar System we use Processing App in our project that used to shows the graph. When any object is in the range which i've defined in the code, it's shows red area in the graph in this one line is moving that mean sensor is moving. If any object not in the range it simply shows Green area in the graph.
